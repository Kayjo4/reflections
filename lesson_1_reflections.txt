How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It aloud me to find all the differences between the two files quickly, without
me having to search through the entire file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

This would make it possible for you to check back through the history to get
different versions of the same file, to allow for bug fixes.

what do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to creat a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

The user can make a more logical commit after completing a portion of the code
rather then parts of a code that might not compile. However, this gives more way
to user error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This allows for the proper files to stay together for proper program functions to work.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git logs shows you all saved versions of a file and git diff allows you to see the
differences between those versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could
break something?

I feel better about it.


now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Learning.
