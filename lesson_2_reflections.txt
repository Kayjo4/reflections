What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? This creates an empty git repository in the directory im in. This will allouw me to be able to make commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers? the working directory shows you all the files in the current directory where as the staging area shows only the file you are ready to commit. This allows me to make seperate logical comits.

How can you use the staging are to make sure you have one commiet per logical change? by commiting certain things in the staging area and giving it a logical name.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? when trying out a new version of my app. branches alows me to make changes but not affect the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? It gives me a great visual as to what is going on.
